# ☁️ Weather Forecast Web App

## 📌 **Project Description**
This project is a **Weather Forecast Web Application** that allows users to enter a city name and retrieve a 3-day weather forecast. The application dynamically updates the weather information displayed on the screen based on the user's input.

## 🔥 **Features**
- 🌍 **Search for any city** to get its weather forecast.
- 📅 Displays a **3-day weather forecast** with temperature, humidity, and conditions.
- 📍 Uses **Geolocation API** to detect the user's current location.
- 📆 Converts the **date returned from the API** into readable day names (e.g., Sunday).
- 🎨 Responsive design that matches or improves upon the provided demo.
- 🌅 **Dynamic Background:** The background changes based on the time of day in the selected city (morning background for daytime and night background for nighttime).

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. The user enters a city name in the search input.
2. The app fetches weather data using the **Weather API**.
3. The UI updates to display the **current weather** and the **next 3 days' forecast**.
4. Optionally, the app can fetch the user's location and automatically display the weather for their area.
5. The background updates dynamically based on the **time of day** in the selected city.
